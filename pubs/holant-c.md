## Abstract

We explore the intricate interdependent relationship among counting 
problems, considered from three frameworks for such problems: 
Holant Problems, counting CSP and weighted H-colorings. We consider 
these problems for general complex valued functions that take Boolean 
inputs. We show that results from one framework can be used to derive 
results in another, and this happens in both directions. Holographic 
reductions discover an underlying unity, which is only revealed when 
these counting problems are investigated in the complex domain $\mathbb{C}$.
We prove three complexity dichotomy theorems, leading to a general theorem 
for Holant<sup>c</sup> problems.  This is the natural class of Holant 
problems where one can assign constants $0$ or $1$. More specifically, 
given any signature grid on $G=(V,E)$ over a set $\mathscr{F}$ of 
symmetric functions, we completely classify the complexity to be in P 
or #P-hard, according to $\mathscr{F}$, of

$$
\begin{equation*}
  \sum_{\sigma: E \rightarrow \{0,1\}} \prod_{v \in V} 
    f_v\left(\sigma|_{E(v)}\right), 
\end{equation*}
$$

where $f_v \in \mathscr{F} \cup \\{0,1\\}$ ($0$ and $1$ are the unary
constant $0$ and $1$ functions).  Not only is holographic reduction 
the main tool, but also the final dichotomy can be only naturally 
stated in the language of  holographic transformations. 
The proof goes through another dichotomy theorem on Boolean 
complex weighted #CSP.
