## Abstract

Holant is a framework of counting characterized by local constraints. 
It is closely related to other well-studied frameworks such as #CSP and 
Graph Homomorphism. An effective dichotomy for such frameworks can settle 
simultaneously the complexity of all combinatorial problems expressible 
in that framework. Both #CSP and Graph Homomorphism can be viewed as 
sub-families of Holant with the additional assumption that the equality 
constraints are always available. Other sub-families of Holant such as 
Holant<sup>\*</sup> and Holant<sup>c</sup> problems, in which we assume 
some specific sets of constraints to be freely available, were also studied. 
The Holant framework becomes more expressive and contains more interesting 
tractable cases with less or no freely available constraint functions, 
while, on the other hand, it also becomes more challenging to obtain a 
complete characterization of its time complexity. Recently, complexity 
dichotomy for a variety of sub-families of Holant such as #CSP, Graph 
Homomorphism, Holant<sup>\*</sup> and Holant<sup>c</sup> were proved. 
The dichotomy for the general Holant framework, which is the most 
desirable, still remains open. In this paper, we prove a dichotomy for 
the general Holant framework where all the constraints are real 
symmetric functions. This setting already captures most of the interesting 
combinatorial problems defined by local constraints, such as (perfect) 
matching, independent set, vertex cover and so on. This is the first 
time a dichotomy is obtained for general Holant Problems without any 
auxiliary functions.

One benefit of working with Holant framework is some powerful new reduction 
techniques such as Holographic reduction. Along the proof of our dichotomy, 
we introduce a new reduction technique, namely realizing a constraint 
function by approximating it. This new technique is employed in our proof 
in a situation where it seems that all previous reduction techniques fail, 
thus this new idea of reduction might also be of independent interest. 
Besides proving dichotomy and developing new technique, we also obtained 
some interesting by-products. We prove a dichotomy for #CSP restricting 
to instances where each variable appears a multiple of $d$ times for any 
$d$.  We also prove that counting the number of Eulerian-Orientations on 
$2k$-regular graphs is #P-hard for any $k \ge 2$.
