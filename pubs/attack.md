## Abstract

To accelerate research on adversarial examples and robustness of machine learning classifiers, 
Google Brain organized a NIPS 2017 competition that encouraged researchers to develop 
new methods to generate adversarial examples as well as to develop new ways to defend against them. 
In this chapter, we describe the structure and organization of the competition and the 
solutions developed by several of the top-placing teams.
