## Abstract

We prove a complexity dichotomy theorem for counting weighted Boolean 
CSP modulo $k$ for any positive integer $k>1$. This generalizes a 
theorem by Faben for the unweighted setting. In the weighted setting, 
there are new interesting tractable problems. We first prove a 
dichotomy theorem for the finite field case where $k$ is a prime. 
It turns out that the dichotomy theorem for the finite field is 
very similar to the one for the complex weighted Boolean #CSP, 
found by [Cai, Lu and Xia, STOC 2009]. Then we further extend the 
result to an arbitrary integer $k$.
