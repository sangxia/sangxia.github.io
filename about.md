Since 2017, I have been working on Machine Learning and IoT projects at Sony Mobile Communications,
Lund, Sweden.

I received my PhD in 2015 from 
[KTH Royal Institute of Technology](www.kth.se), where I was extremely fortunate to be advised 
by [Prof. Johan HÃ¥stad](www.csc.kth.se/johanh). 
I then did a postdoc at [EPFL](www.epfl.ch), under the supervision of [Prof. Ola Svensson](theory.epfl.ch/osven).

I did my undergraduate studies at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](www.sjtu.edu.cn). 
I had also worked as an intern student at 
[Theory Group of Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/msra-theory/), 
supervised by [Prof. Pinyan Lu](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/pinyan/). 
During the fall semester of 2013, I visited [Prof. Ryan O'Donnell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/) at 
[Carnegie Mellon University](www.cmu.edu). 
I also did a summer internship at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](www.ttic.edu) with 
[Prof. Madhur Tulsiani](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~madhurt/) June - August, 2014.
